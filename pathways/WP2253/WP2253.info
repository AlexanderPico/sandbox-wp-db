description: This pathway shows the relationship between BRAF signalling and the development and behavior of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), normally induced by MAPK pathway activation.   BRAF is related in two alternative mechanisms in MAPK activation; first oncogenic fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1 (highlighted in yellow); second a 3 basepair insertion in BRAF (KIAA1549, again in yellow).   This pathway is based on Figure 3" An overview of MAPK pathway alterations in PAs" from [https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2009.73 Jones et al].
