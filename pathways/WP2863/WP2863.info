description: This plant pathway represents the Krebs cycle (mitochondrion). Pyruvate is imported from the glycolysis (WP2862) and converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle by getting linked with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid. The cycle produces ATP and NADH, releases CO2 and finally regenerated oxaloacetic acid.
