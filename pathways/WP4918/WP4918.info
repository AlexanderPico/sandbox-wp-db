description: In order to maintain protein homeostasis and cell function, cells are constantly synthesizing as well as degrading proteins. This is especially important when proteins are misfolded, due to extra- or intracellular stress or a genetic mutation, as this is the basis for many diseases. This pathway shows the major events which are involved in proteostasis.
