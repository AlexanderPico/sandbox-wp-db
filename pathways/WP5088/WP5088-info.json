    "description": "This pathway describes elements of Prostaglandin signaling in Homo sapiens affected by COVID-19. Prostaglandins are amongst the many inflammatory mediators that incite a cytokine storm in COVID-19 after Bradykinin receptor B1 (BDKRB1) activation. This pathway mainly focuses on PGE2 and PGI2 and their interactions that lead to hyperinflammation via cytokine storms, immunothrombosis as well as the recruitment of fibrosis-mediating factors (VEGF, TGFB1, AREG). These pathways take place in multiple cell types such as: Monocytes, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, Th17 cells, Nk cells, et cetera.",
