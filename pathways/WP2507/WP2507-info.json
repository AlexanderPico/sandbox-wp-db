    "description": "Apotosis caused by nanomaterials, such as single-walled carbon nanohorns, titanium oxide, and polystyrene nanoparticles, may be induced through lysosomal impairment. For example, PAMAMs have been found to cause mitochondrial membrane destabilization, and silver and gold nanoparticles are reported to induce ER stress, which may lead to cytochrome c release from mitochondria.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2507 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
