    "description": "Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris L.) belongs to the plant family Amaranthaceae and is a biennial plant responding to long days after a cold period. It is, however, cultivated as an annual crop, since the sucrose stored in the thickened taproot during the first vegetation period is used for bolting and flowering in the second growing season in response to vernalization thus reducing sugar yield. Much less is known on flowering time regulation in sugar beet than in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. One major gene involved in bolting/flowering time control in sugar beet is BTC1, controlling expression of the two beet FT homologs, of which one (BvFT1) has become a floral repressor, whereas the other (BvFT2) has retained its flowering-promoting function.",
