description: Model of eIF5A regulation in response to inhibition of the nuclear export system. Under normal conditions, IGF2BP1 is exported by XPO1 and binds to eIF5A in cytoplasm. The binding with IGF2BP1 prevents eIF5A from accumulating in mitochondria. SINE (Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export) inhibits the nuclear export of IGF2BP1, resulting in decreased cytoplasmic IGF2BP1. Unbound eIF5A accumulates in mitochondria and induces apoptosis.
