    "description": "Proposed model for the mechanism of colon cancer metastasis to the liver involves exporting miR-193a via exosomes sorted by major vault protein (MVP).  In pre-metastatic cells miR-193a suppresses mouse colon cancer progression by directly targeting Caprin1, which is known to positively regulate the cell cycle and cell proliferation. Higher levels of miR-193a in tumor cells causes of cell cycle G1 arrest and cell proliferation repression  through reduction of Caprin1 expression. In metatstatic cells, increased levels of MVP leads to MVP-mediated selective sorting of tumor suppressor miRNA into exosomes, which promotes tumor progression.",
