description: Proposed metabolic pathway of flavan-3-ols (also known as flavanols) in humans. Flavanols are derivatives of flavans and include catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, theaflavins, thearubigins.  These compounds differ considerably not only in their structural and functional properties, but also in their metabolism and bioavailability. Green arrows indicate microbiota-mediated steps, and Red arrows represent mammalian enzyme-mediated conversions. Pink arrows indicate steps that can be both microbiota- or enzyme-mediated. This pathway was developed based upon 22 papers, therefore black arrows indicate missing information regarding the nature of conversion. Acknowledgements: This pathway is based upon work from COST Action POSITIVe, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology.
