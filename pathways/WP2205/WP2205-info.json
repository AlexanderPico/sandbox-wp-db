    "description": "Carotenoids pigments in plants are a family of secondary metabolites that participate in light harvesting. They are essential for photoprotection against excess light. carotenoids are also the precursors for the biosynthesis of plant hormones such as abscisic acid and strigolactones. The biosynthesis occurs in the plastid organelle of higher plants.",
