    "description": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that are important for the regulation of numerous biological processes. Accordingly, the expression of miRNAs is itself tightly controlled by mechanisms acting at the level of transcription as well as processing of miRNA precursors. Recently, active degradation of mature miRNAs has been identified as another mechanism that is important for miRNA homeostasis. In cultured human cells, ribosomal RNA processing protein 41 (RRP41) and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPT1) degrade specific miRNAs in the 3'-to-5'direction.
