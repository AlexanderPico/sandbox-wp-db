description: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) lies at the core of the transcriptional cascade that regulates adipogenesis. The expression of PPARG is regulated by several pro-adipogenic (green) and anti-adipogenic (orange) factors. PPARG itself is activated by an as-yet-uncharacterized ligand. CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPA) is regulated through a series of inhibitory protein–protein interactions. Some transcription-factor families have several members that participate in adipogenesis, such as the Krüppel-like factors (KLFs). Rosen et al. Figure 2a
