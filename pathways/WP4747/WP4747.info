description: UNC-5 Homolog B (UNC5B) is a member of the dependence receptor family. It can induce two opposite intracellular signaling cascades depending on the presence or absence of the ligand and is thus capable of driving two opposing processes. UNC5B signaling has been implicated in several cancers, where it promotes cell death in the absence of its ligand netrin-1 and increases cell survival in its presence. In addition, inhibition of the ligand has been reported to decrease invasiveness and angiogenesis in tumors. UNC5B signaling pathway has also been reported to be involved in several processes such as neural development, developmental angiogenesis and inflammatory processes. Interaction of UNC5B with netrins activates various signaling modules including ERK1/ERK2, p38 MAPK signaling and PI3k-AKT pathway modules
