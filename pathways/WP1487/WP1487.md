description: 'The upregulation of mucine is regulated by three different pathways
  which result in the activation of NF-kB. After TNF-alpha activated its receptor
  and recruited several adaptor proteins, the IKK complex is activated to inhibit
  IKBa, resulting in the activation and translocation into the nucleus of NF-kB and
  upregulation of mucine and IL-6. After EGFR activation by TGF-alpha binding, the
  RAS-MAPK-pp90 RSK pathway leads to inactivation of IKBa and thus to the translocation
  of NF-kB. Further, pp90 RSK leads to binding of Sp1 transcription factor to its
  DNA binding site.  By activating Tlr4, LPS can inhibit IKBa. '
