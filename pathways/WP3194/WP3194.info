description: Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound proteins that act as transcription factors. They regulate lipid, especially cholesterol, biosynthesis and uptake at a transcriptional level to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis. In addition, SREBP appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes. This pathway of SREBP focusses on the regulation of lipid metabolism by SREBP. The data on which this pathway is based, is derived from a variety of in vitro and in vivo studies using different species, including mouse, rat, hamster and human.  This pathway served as the basis for a review about SREBP that was published in Genes and Nutrition: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23516131 PubMed].
