description: Photodynamic therapy may induce a proteotoxic stress response mediated by transcription factors heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), activating transcription factor (ATF) 6, and ATF4.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3613 CPTAC Assay Portal]
