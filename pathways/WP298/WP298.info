description: The G13 subunit is an alpha unit of heterotrimeric G proteins that regulates cell processes through the use of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. G13 regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling in cells and is essential for receptor tyrosine kinase-induced migration of fibroblast and endothelial cells.
