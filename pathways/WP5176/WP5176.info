description: This pathway model displays disorders of bile acid synthesis and biliary transport. There are 13 included disorders, of which 8 are enzyme deficiencies, and 5 are related to transporters. The enzyme deficiencies include 3β-Dehydrogenase deficiency, 5β-Reductase deficiency, Spastic Paraplegia 5A, Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency, Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency, α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency, Bile acid amidation defect, and Bile acid-CoA ligase deficiency (BA CoA LD). Disorders of transporters are related to deficiencies in ATP8B1 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1; PFIC1), ABCB11 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2; PFIC 2), ABCB4 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3), and ABCC2 (Dubin-Johnson syndrome), as well as OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 disease (Rotor Syndrome). This pathway is based on Chapter 34 of Blau’s ‘Physicians Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
