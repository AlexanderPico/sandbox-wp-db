    "description": "This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Sphingolipids pathway [https://lipidmaps.org/pathway/pathways_maps]. Sphingolipids are a class of lipids, which act as signal transduction and cell recognition molecules. This pathway provides an overview of the different tail lengths (on the right), which are used to convert sphinganine to DH-ceramide. All products are annotated with a lipid-class identifier. The integrated pathway can be found [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4690 here].",
