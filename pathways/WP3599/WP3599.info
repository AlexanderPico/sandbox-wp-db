description: The transcription factors involved in adipogenesis are shown in the current pathway. Adipogensis is the biological proces of cell differentation in which preadipocytes are converted into adipocytes.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3599 CPTAC Assay Portal].
