description: This pathway is based on the figure 2 of "Toll-like Receptors: Novel Pharmacological Targets for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases" and figure 2 of "Toll-like receptor and its roles in myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury" (see bibliography). The Toll-like receptors are used by mammals to recognize pathogen-associated molecules such as the cell wall components. The activation of TLR4 causes a cell's inability to produce TNFa. TLR4 deals with MyD88 independent and dependent pathways, and due to LPS tolerant cells, inhibitors of the MyD88 dependent pathway are increased. TLR is important in the creation of protective immune responses to cancers, and the protection of brain tissue from injury.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3851 CPTAC Assay Portal].
