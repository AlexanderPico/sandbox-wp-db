description: A model of apoptotic cell engulfment.   Caenorhabditis (from Caeno  and rhabditis = rod like stick shaped) elegans is a free living (non parasitic) transparent roundworm (nematode).  C. elegans was the first organism to have its whole genome sequenced and it neuronal wiring described.  The C. elegans engulfment pathway removes the dying ("corpse") cells by using receptor signals then identifying the dying cells and eventually engulfing them.  The final process involves the recycling of the remaining cell particles of the dead engulfed cells.
