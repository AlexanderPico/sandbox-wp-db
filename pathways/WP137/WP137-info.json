    "description": "Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B<sub>6<\/sub> and is a cofactor in many reactions  of amino acid metabolism. Pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxal (PL),  pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) are all forms of  vitamin B<sub>6<\/sub> that can be converted to PLP via the PLP salvage pathway.  Most unicellular organisms and plants can synthesize PLP, whereas mammals cannot and require vitamin B<sub>6<\/sub> in their diet.  Thus far, three PLP biosynthetic pathways have been characterized: the de novo PLP biosynthesis pathway as characterized in <I>Escherichia coli<\/I> (CITS: [12686115]), the de novo PLP biosynthesis pathway as being studied in fungi (CITS: [15483325],[14764090]), and the PLP salvage pathway (CITS: [15483325], [17696614],[8764513],[9537380]). <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/I> synthesize PLP via the fungal type de novo PLP synthesis pathway and the PLP salvage pathway (CITS: [7896706], [17696614], [15483325], [14764090]). Extracellular PN, PL and PM are transported into the cell by Tpn1p, a member of the purine-cytosine permease family (CITS: [12649274]).
