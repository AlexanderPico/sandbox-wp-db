description: Osteoblasts are specialized, terminally differentiated uninucleated cells responsible for bone formation. Their activity is tightly regulated by external stimuli, originating from e.g. the parathyroid glands, osteocytes, etc.   Along with osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone degradation, osteoblasts are key regulators of the shape and volume of bone tissue.
