description: Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of the Ebstein-Barr Virus (EBV) elicits its oncogenice effects through the activation of several downstream pathways suchs as Pi3K/akt, IRF4, and NFkB pathways.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP262 CPTAC Assay Portal]
