description: Adapted from Raza et al. (2008). This pathway is initiated by IFNG binding to its receptor and a subsequent phosphorylation cascade involving a number of the JAK and STAT family of proteins. Several transcriptionally active complexes are formed (STAT1 homodimer, ISGF3 complex, STAT1:STAT1:IRF9 complex) and the pathway culminates with the transcriptional activation of target genes. [1]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP619 CPTAC Assay Portal]
