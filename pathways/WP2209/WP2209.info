description: Phytoalexins Momilactone A and B accumulate in rice husks. Both compounds act in multiple ways such as (1) growth inhibitors involved in seed dormancy, (2) play an important role in the rice plant defense system against pathogens and insects and (3) contribute to allelopathy where they inhibit the growth of weeds. They are also known to be induced by the jasmonic acid plant growth hormone.
