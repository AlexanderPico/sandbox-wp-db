    "description": "Regulation of FABP4 in ovarian cancer. FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein) can substantially increase metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells, and leads to more aggressive disease. Mir-409-3p negatively regulates FABP4 in ovarian cancer cells, and mir-409-3p is decreased in hypoxic conditions. Pink arrows indicates potential therapuetic therapeutic stratgeies; in Gharpure et al, DOPC nanoliposomes containing either miR-409-3p mimic or FABP4 siRNA was shown to inhibit tumor progression.  Description was adapted from Gharpure et al.",
