    "description": "The recently identified type III interferon group consists of three IFN-位 (lambda) genes encoding molecules called IFN-位1, IFN-位2 and IFN-位3 (also called IL29, IL28A and IL28B respectively). These IFNs signal through a receptor complex consisting of IL10R2 (also called CRF2-4) and IFNLR1 (also called CRF2-12).",
