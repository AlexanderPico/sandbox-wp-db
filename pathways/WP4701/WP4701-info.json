    "description": "Monoterpenes (C10) are the major group of compounds within the essential oils of the mint (Lamiaceae) family. Peppermint (Mentha Ã— piperita)is considered a model system for the study of monoterpene metabolism, which main steps are depicted in this pathway.   This pathway is annotated well enough for data analysis, however please do not add the \"Approved Version\" tag yet, since this allocates the PW to the incorrect species (grape vs mint). The WikiPathways team is working on a solution.",
