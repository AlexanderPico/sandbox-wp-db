    "description": "Equilibrium signalling pathway for maintenance of progenitor cells in the lymph gland which is also affected by hedgehog protein niche signaling. Nup98 and Bip1 proteins both necessary for Pvr gene expression. Pvr/STAT92E complex activates Adgf-A to break down adenosine. Break down allows for proper maintenance of progenitor cells in equilibrium signalling. Niche signalling includes the expression of hedgehog by posterior signaling center also promoting progenitor maintenance. This pathway is based on figure 7 from Mondal et al.",
