    "description": "Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a cereal species with major economic and agricultural impact, is a facultative long-day plant, i.e. it flowers earlier in response to long days than to short days. Flowering time genes of the photoperiod, vernalization and circadian clock pathways are best studied in barley. The Ppd-H1 gene, a pseudo-response regulator gene, is thought to be key for flowering induction under long days. Further important genes which convey flowering in barley under both photoperiods are homologs of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and CONSTANS (CO). Flowering in response to vernalization is economically important in temperate cereals like barley and wheat and is controlled by the interaction of Vrn-H1 and Vrn-H2.",
