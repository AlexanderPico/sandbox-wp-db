    "description": "Converted from rat to human using ortholog information, originally from KEGG. Originally edited by Sebastien Burel.   This pathway describes the metabolism of amino acids alanine and aspartate. Alanine is broken down by oxidative deamination, the inverse reaction of the reductive amination biosynthesis, catalyzed by the same enzymes.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP106 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
