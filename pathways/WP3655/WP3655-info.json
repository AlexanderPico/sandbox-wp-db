    "description": "Hypothetical pathway linking cranio-facial development pathway (IRF6, TP63, TFAP2A, and TGFB3) to Rho signaling pathway through ARHGAP29 regulation. Authors of literature suspect that a decrease of ARHGAP29 concentration would result in more active form, Rho-GTP, which would down-regulate cranio-facial development genes. An implication of this active Rho-GTP may be the formation of cleft lip. This pathway is based on figure 4 from Leslie et al.",
