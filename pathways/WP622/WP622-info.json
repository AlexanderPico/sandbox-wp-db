    "description": "Flowering time in a plant is associated often with the property of when the plant flowers. However, this property is dependent on several components of the environment (light, photoperiod and temperature), gene regulation, and several biological processes besides the genetic makeup of the plant. The time taken by the plant to flower also depends on when the vegetative shoot apical meristem transitions into the reproductive shoot apical meristem. The correct timing and perception of the signal are essential to successful flower development in a timely manner. In Arabidopsis, the day length (photoperiod) can control several plant processes including the flowering time. Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day plant since its flowering is promoted by the long days (~16 hours light; 8 hours dark), and delayed, in short-day conditions (8 hours light, 16 hours dark). As compared to rice which is a short-day plant. Flowering in rice is induced by a short day length photoperiod.",
