    "description": "Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway interacting with Arf/Mdm2/p53 cell cycle pathway to regulate cell growth and proliferation. The signalling of a mitogen acts through the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway to inhibit the Rb protein and allow Myc and E2fs to continue into S phase and inhibits the Arf/Mdm2/p53 pathway leading to growth arrest or apoptosis. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway also directly acts on the Arf/Mdm2/p53 pathway with Dmp1 to prevent tumor formation by activating Arf. Arf inhibits Mdm2 allowing p53 to lead the cell to growth arrest or apoptosis. This pathway is based on figure 7 from Sreeramaneni et al.",
