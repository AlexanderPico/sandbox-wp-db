    "description": "G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and G protein\u2013linked receptors (GPLR), constitute a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with G proteins, they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor Wikipedia]   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP24 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
