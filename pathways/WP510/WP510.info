description: The MAPK/ERK pathway is a signal transduction pathway that couples intracellular responses to the binding of growth factors to cell surface receptors. In many cell types, activation of this pathway promotes cell division. Adapted from: http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget-bin/get_pathway?org_name=sce&mapno=04010
