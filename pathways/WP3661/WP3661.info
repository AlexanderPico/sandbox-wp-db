description: The pathway initiated by GLC activates the AtHXK1/GIN2 complex and can also interact with a AtHXK1 independent pathway. The AtHXK1/GIN2 complex functions to activate ABA2/ABA3 protein complex, also regulated by stress, to catalyze production of abscisic acid, a compound that both directly and indirectly promotes seed development, but inhibits germination, cotyledon greening, expansion, shoot development, and flowering (plant development). The AtHXK1/GIN2 complex also activates auxin to inhibit the plant development processes and represses cytokinin as well as the ethylene signaling pathway to stop promotion of plant growth. This pathway is based on figure 5 from Rolland et al and figure 3 from Ramon et al.
