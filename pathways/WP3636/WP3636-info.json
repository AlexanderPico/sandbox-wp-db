    "description": "Many catabolic pathways begin with an ATP-requiring activation step, after which further metabolism yields a surplus of ATP. Such a 'turbo' principle is useful but also contains an inherent risk. This is illustrated by a detailed kinetic analysis of glycolysis in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant. The model has been converted to GPML using the PathSBML plugin from PathVIsio, importing the model BIOMD0000000253 from the BioModels Database directly. The layout has been improved manually.",
