    "description": "The different classess of factors involved in adipogenesis are shown. Adipogenesis is the process by which fat cells differentiate from preadipocytes to adipocytes (fat cells). Adipose tissue, composed of white and brown adipose tissue, is composed of adipocytes. This pathway is primarily studied to understand factors that contribute to obesity and diabetes. Transcriptional and hormonal regulators of adipocyte formation are indicated.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP236 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
