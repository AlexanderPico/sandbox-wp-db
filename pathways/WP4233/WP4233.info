description: Acrylamide (AA) is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is converted to toxic glycidamide (GA) by cytochrome P450 2E1. Both AA and GA are coupled with glutathione (GSH) in the liver to form conjugates that are metabolized in the kidney and urinary tract to form modified merbapturic acids (AAMA and GAMA) that serve as biomarkers for AA in urine. Meanwhile, haemoglobin adducts are formed in the blood, including AA-Valine and GA-Valine. Genotoxic and carcinogenic activity is mediated by GA and the formation of DNA adducts with guanine and adenosine.
