description: Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?mtu00340 KEGG Pathways]  Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogenic bacterial species in the family Mycobacteriaceae and the causative agent of tuberculosis. First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, M. tuberculosis can appear either Gram-negative or Gram-positive. Several of the proteins needed for hystidine metabolism are not present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resulting in incomplete knowledge on the formation of for example imidazole-4-acetaldehyde and N-methylhistamine.
