description: 'The pentose phosphate pathway is important for generating NADPH,  which
  is a source of reducing energy, as well as a variety of sugar  molecules that are
  required for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and  amino acids. (CITS:[8929392])(CITS:[8910528])(CITS:[9813062])(CITS:[
  11298766])(CITS:[1628611])(CITS:[15960801])(CITS:[7916691])(CITS:[14690456]).  This
  pathway is also important for protecting yeast from oxidative  stress, since NADPH
  is an essential cofactor for glutathione- and  thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that
  defend cells against oxidative  damage (CITS:[8929392])(CITS:[8910528])(CITS:[11557322])(CITS:[16179340]).  The
  pentose phosphate pathway is of industrial interest for the fermentation of xylose
  to ethanol (CITS:[11916674]). Xylose is the predominant sugar found in biomass such
  as agricultural wastes, wood, municipal solid wastes, and wastes from pulp and paper
  industries,  and possibly could serve as a low-cost and abundant raw material for  fuel
  ethanol production (CITS:[8534086]). Saccharomyces cerevisiae does  not naturally
  metabolize xylose, but recombinant S. cerevisiae  strains containing the xylose
  reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase  genes from Pichia stipitis are able to metabolize
  xylose via the  pentose phosphate pathway (CITS:[15630585])(CITS:[8534086]). Changes
  in  the levels of enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway effect the  fitness,
  ethanol production, and amount of xylose metabolized by  these recombinant xylose-utilizing
  strains.  The pentose phosphate pathway is also of medical interest because mutations
  in the human homologs of some yeast pentose phosphate genes  are associated with
  a variety of diseases.  Zwf1p is homologus to  human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD), which has been  implicated in neonatal jaundice and haemolytic anemia. Sol3p
  and  Sol4p have similarity to human PGLS, which is associated with 6- phosphogluconolactonase
  deficiency and may contribute to some forms  of G6PD-associated hemolytic anemia
  (CITS:[10518023]). Sol3p and Sol4p  also have similarity to human H6PD, which is
  associated with  cortisone reductase deficiency (CITS:[10518023]). Gnd1p and Gnd2p
  have  similarity to human PGD, mutation in which may also contribute to  some forms
  of G6PD-associated hemolytic anemia (CITS:[10518023]). Tal1p  is similar to human
  TALDO1, mutation in which has been reported to be  associated with transaldolase
  deficiency and hepatosplenomegaly (CITS:[ 8300619]). Rki1p has similarity to human
  RPIA, which has been  associated with ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency,  leukoencephalopathy
  and peripheral neuropathy (CITS:[16054529]).   SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
