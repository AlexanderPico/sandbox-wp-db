description: The hepatic ANGPTL8 (Angiopoietin Like Protein 8) regulatory pathway represents an up-to-date curated interactive pathway for all of the interactions from the known regulators of ANGPTL8 and updated signaling events of insulin signaling in the liver.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3915 CPTAC Assay Portal]
