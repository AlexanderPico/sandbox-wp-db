description: The major function of the distal convoluted tubule 1 cell (DCT1 cell) in the kidney is to maintain proper iron, solute and water homeostasis. The cells are polarized and located in the nephron duct where they have unique transport functions which are maintained by specialized K(+), Na(+), and Cl(-) channels in the proximal or distal part of the cell.
