    "description": "Ciliary landscape pathway - according to Boldt et al. 2016 - was constructed using the results of affinity proteomics for 217 proteins with known or suspected involvement in ciliary function, resulting in a landscape of 1319 proteins and 4905 interactions of which the most important are shown here (derived from Figure 1). Ciliary function is impaired in a wide spectrum of diseases (ciliopathies) including polycystic kidney disease, Usher syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, and Jeune syndrome.",
