description: This pathway shows the interaction between a Natural Killer cell and a pancreatic tumor cell. With the specific cell receptors found on the NK cell, it is able to recognize malignant cells and secrete cytokines and chemokines to create an enhanced immune response. Their ability to activate both innate- as well as adaptive immune cells makes the NK cell an excellent target for novel immunotherapy treatments against pancreatic cancer. The pathway curation is mainly based on a systemic review by Van Audenaerde et al. in 2018 (10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.04.003).
