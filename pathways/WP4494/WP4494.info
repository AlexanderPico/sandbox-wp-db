description: Selective expression of chemokine receptors during T-cell polarization. Pathway based on Biocarta pathway (M4047). https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_nktPathway  The polarization of T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is associated with their expression of subsets of chemokine receptors. While not being exposed to antigens, na√Øve T cells express CXCR4 and CCR7 receptors. TGF-beta van induce semi-naive T cells, that express a subset of CCR4 and CCR7 receptors. Th1 express CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 receptors, while Th2 express CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5. However these subsets are not absolute as there is overlap between the expression of receptor subsets and thus between Th1 and Th2 cells.
