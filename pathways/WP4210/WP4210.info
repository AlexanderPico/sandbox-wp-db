description: Scheme of mammalian tryptophan catabolism. Briefly, in mammalian cells, tryptophan is used mostly for protein synthesis. In a second quantitatively important pathway (driven by IDO in most cell types and by TDO more specifically in liver cells), it is the starting point of the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway gives birth to several metabolites, providing the appropriate enzymes that metabolize the various kynurenine intermediates are expressed. The main route of the kynurenine pathway leads to the formation of N -formyl kynurenine, L -kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthra- nilic acid, quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and in fine nicotinamine adenine dinucleotides. Additional lateral branches of the kynurenine pathway lead to the formation of other terminal kynurenines, such as KA, xanthurenic acid, and anthranilic acid. Kynurenines indicated in boldface type ( i.e. L -kynurenine and KA) correspond to the most abundant kynurenines found in caput epididymal tissue. Outside the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan is also the precursor of serotonin and melatonin. A very small proportion of tryptophan is also transformed into indol derivatives, such as indoxyl acetic acid. Conversion of Trp to N -formyl kynurenine is achieved via IDO and/or TDO.   The kynurenine pathway can lead to the intracellular NAD+ production and consumption. De novo synthesis begins with the conversion of tryptophan to quinolate, which is converted to NaMN. NaMN is then adenylylated to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+), which is converted to NAD+. NAD+-consuming enzymes break the bond between the Nam and ADP-ribosyl moieties. Nam, which is also provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN, which is adenylylated to form NAD+. Na, which is provided in the diet and, potentially, by bacterial degradative pathways in vertebrates, is salvaged to form NaMN. NR, which occurs extracellularly in blood and milk and can be provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN. Na and Nam are also converted to nicotinuric acid and N-methylnicotinamide elimination products.
