description: Taken from KEGG: Glycosaminoglycan degradation - Homo sapiens (human) [https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa00531].  Some genes such as NAGZ could not be found, these have been left on the diagram as unannotated GeneProducts.  Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.
