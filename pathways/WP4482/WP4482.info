description: Vitamin D in inflammatory diseases.  Inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Proinflammatory stimuli lead to p38MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation which subsequently induces expression of many proinflammatory proteins. MED14 is part of the mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcriptional initiation and it was found to form a complex with VDR and mediate ligand-dependent enhancement of transcription by the VDR. SMAD, NFAT and NFÎºB signaling and modulation of these signaling pathways by VDR/RXR.
