description: The selenium-centred micronutrient biological network. The most relevant biochemical processes related to selenium in the context of metabolism, oxidation and inflammation are represented. Also, the compartmental separation (intracellular vs. plasma) is presented, identifying the selenium centred plasma metabolome. A selenoprotein database exists at: http://www.selenodb.org
