    "description": "Fibroblasts are known to contribute to tissue and organ connectivity by producing and secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Although several diseases, such as fibrosis and cancer, have been linked to changes in fibroblast metabolism, the resting metabolic conditions that are present in healthy cells generally go unreported. Because fibroblasts are known to display heterogeneity, the metabolic processes of different tissues may vary. The aim was to identify and map out the general metabolic pathways present in fibroblasts. The pathways for collagen, serine, and proline, as well as glycosaminoglycan synthesis, are nearly complete. Nonetheless, dashed arrows indicate missing process steps that should be identified and included. There is a lack of data on fibroblasts' metabolic activities, and further research is required to understand the complete metabolic pathways of fibroblasts.",
