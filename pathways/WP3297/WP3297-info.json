    "description": "Summary of reported EV release from cardiac cells in culture and their functional effects. EV release has been reported in numerous cell lines and primary cultures, both at baseline and in response to stimuli. Transfer of EVs between cell types has been demonstrated as well as delivery of cargo.  Note that this pathway represents a review of multiple studies in multiple organisms. This pathway displays the human orthologs.  HUVEC: human aortic endothelial cell  HMEC-1: human microvascular endothelial cell  HASMC: human aortic smooth muscle cell  NRVM: neonatal rat ventricular myocyte.   Adapted from Danielson KM, Das S.
