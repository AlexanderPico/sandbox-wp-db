    "description": "Stathmin (SMTMN1) normally binds to alpha-beta tubulin heterodimers, but this process is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. In this way phosphorylated Stathmin indirectly promotes polymerization. PDGFRÎ± dephosphorylates STMN1, which leads to increased tubulin depolymerization. Vinblastine inhibits polymerization, effectively resulting in depolymerization. During mitosis, this triggers the defense mechanism \"spindle assembly checkpoint\" (SAC), which and results in either apoptosis or mitotic slippage.",
