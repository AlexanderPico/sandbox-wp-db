    "description": "The transcription factor Nfe2l2 (alias: Nrf2), which acts as an antioxidant, is tightly regulated in the cytosol through proteasomal degradation by Keap1. When appropriate stimuli, such as oxidative stress, cause changes in Keap1, Nfe2l2 is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements and activates gene expression. Nfe2l2 plays a critical role in regulating redox homeostasis, differentiation, and maturation by modulating the expression of cytoprotective genes like Hmox1, Nqo1, and glutathione. Nfe2l2 is involved in various cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, and inflammation, by promoting antioxidative gene expression, suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibiting Nfkb signaling. Aberrant function or expression of Nfe2l2 is linked to pathological conditions such as inflammation, autoimmunity, cancer, and neurodegeneration.",
