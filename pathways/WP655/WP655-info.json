    "description": "p53 (also known as protein 53 or tumor protein 53), is a transcription factor which in humans is encoded by the TP53 gene. p53 is important in multicellular organisms, where it regulates the cell cycle and thus functions as a tumor suppressor that is involved in preventing cancer. As such, p53 has been described as \"the guardian of the genome,\" \"the guardian angel gene,\" and the \"master watchman,\" referring to its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation.",
