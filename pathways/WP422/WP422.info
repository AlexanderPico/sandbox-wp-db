description: The MAPK cascades are central signaling pathways that regulate a wide variety of stimulated cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and stress response. Therefore, dysregulation, or improper functioning of these cascades, is involved in the induction and progression of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and developmental abnormalities.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP422 CPTAC Assay Portal]
