description: The activated IGF-1R (Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) regulates cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal organization and migration through interaction with adhesion molecules and integrin. In normal physiology the IGF-1R stimulates linear body growth, promotes neuronal survival and myelination, postnatal mammary gland development and lactation and is implicated in bone formation and renal function (Fortes et al,2013).
