    "description": "Resistin induced intracellular signaling pathways. No receptor for resistin has yet been identified. Resistin induces NF-kB activity. Resistin increases the cytosolic Ca concentration via both PLC activation, leading to the release of Ca from intracellular pools, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca influx from the extracellular environment. Activation of the abovementioned signaling pathways via resistin suggests that it has proinflammatory potential.",
