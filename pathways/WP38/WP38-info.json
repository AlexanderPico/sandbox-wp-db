    "description": "The fatty acid synthesis of the roundworm C. Elegans is a highly conserved pathway evolutionary. This pathways is therefore of great importance to understand fat synthesis and nutrient sensing in adiposity regulation, which is key to understand the molecular mechanism behind obesity.",
