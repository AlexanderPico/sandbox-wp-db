description: This pathway visualises the conversion of methionine to inorganic sulphates (involving the formation of homocysteine, a  toxic intermediate also related to MTHFR deficiency [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4288]). Methionine, an essential amino acid, is taken in from diet and can be created from breaking down proteins.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 3 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
