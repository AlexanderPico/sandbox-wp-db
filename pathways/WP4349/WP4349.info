description: This pathway is inspired by the LIPID MAPS>Eicosanoids Pathway expended pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php] and extended with the bottom left side of Figure 1 from Dennis and Norris (2015 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139350]). Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA), either via cyclooxygenases (COX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347], lipooxygenases(LOX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348], or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349]. This pathway visualises the third route, via CYP.  Orange boxes represent peroxisome-proliferator activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.
