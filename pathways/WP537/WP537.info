description: Protein synthesis is the ultimate step of gene expression and a key control point for regulation. In particular, it enables cells to rapidly manipulate protein production without new mRNA synthesis, processing, or export. This pathway gives an overview of the translation factors involved in this process.  Description from source pathway: http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP107 (translated via homology)
