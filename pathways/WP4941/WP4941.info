description: A disease model demonstrating the potential place of the GPR143 gene in the pathogenesis of ocular albinism type 1. The latter shows the interactions between GPR143 and the different genes responsible for melanogenesis as well as growth factors such as SERPINF1 and VEGF in melanocytes or the retinal pigment epithelium.
