    "description": "Synthesis of ceramides and 1-deoxyceramides from serine and alanine, respectively, including the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids in humans. Multiple more complex sphingolipid synthesis reactions were added to improve pathway versatility. 1-deoxyceramide synthesis shows a lot of similarities with ceramide synthesis but does not come close in terms of documentation, hence this comprehensive figure.",
