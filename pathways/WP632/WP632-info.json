    "description": "Cholesterol is essential for life - it's a required for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for many other biochemical pathways.  Cholesterol is synthesized throughout the body but mainly in liver, intestines, adrenal glands and reproductive organs. Synthesis starts with the combination of Acetyl-CoA and Acetoacetyl-CoA.
