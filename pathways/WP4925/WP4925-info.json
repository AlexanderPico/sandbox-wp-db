    "description": "The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway regulates and protects the cell from improperly folded protein overload in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The UPR can result in the slowing of protein synthesis, which gives the cell time to translate more chaperones to help process the proteins. If the stress is too high, the UPR can eventually trigger apoptosis.",
