Originally adapted from:  [https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa00380 KEGG], and expanded with information from [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.05.003 Agus 2018], [https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1178646919852996 Dehhaghi 2019], and [https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmz127 Gao 2020].  \"The tryptophan (Trp) metabolism follows three major pathways in the gastrointestinal tract: 1. direct transformation of Trp, including ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), by the gut microbiota; 2. through the kynurenine pathway in both immune and epithelial cells via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1; 3. the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) production pathway in enterochromaffin cells via Trp hydroxylase 1 (TpH1).\"  [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.05.003 Agus 2018].   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP465 CPTAC Assay Portal].",
