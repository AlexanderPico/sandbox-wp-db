description: Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?mtu00785 KEGG Pathways]. The lipoic acid metabolism is a subcategory of the "Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins". The salvage pathway is not understood for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and therefore only the biosynthesis is described here.
