description: Human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary lobe, which plays an important physiological role in regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid by stimulating production and secretion of the thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland. TSH binds to TSH receptor which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins. TSH exerts its action through various signaling cascades such as cAMP cascade and the phospholipase C beta-mediated inositol phosphate generation. Further, it will give signaling to NF-kappa B, mitogen activated protein kinases, protein kinase C modules.
