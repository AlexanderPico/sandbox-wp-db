description: Immune checkpoints are hardwired into the immune system and are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks.  One such immune checkpoint is PD-1 (programmed cell death 1 protein), which binds to its ligand PD-L1 and inhibits immune cell activity, including T cell activity. By upregulating PD-L1, cancer cells can inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack.  One strategy for cancer immunotherapy is to block this kind of negative feedback, thereby increasing anti-cancer T-cell activity. For the PD-1 checkpoint, cancer immunotherapeutics block either the PD-1 receptor, or the PD-L1 ligand.
