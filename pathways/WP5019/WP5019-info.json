    "description": "Acetogenesis from H2 and CO2 in Acetobacterium woodii, based on Figure 3 from Diender et al (2015) [PMID:26635746]. This pathway model shows both proposed theoretical pathways of CO conversion to acetate, as well as the acetogenic metabolism driven by CO co-fermented with formate. Two large complexes are involved in this process (top right corner): 1. the RnF complex (sodium ion transport outside of the cell membrane) 2. the ATPase complex (sodium ion translocation to inner cell membrane).",
