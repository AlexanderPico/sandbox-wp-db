    "description": "Laminopathies resulting form a range of LMNA mutations result in a range of tissue specific phenotypes. These rare diseases may be attributed to a symptomatic overlap characterized by the convergence of lamin A downstream signalling pathways. Lamin A is expressed in differentiating cells and thus this pathway highlights the major molecular signalling pathways mis regulated during hMSC differentiation due to varying LMNA mutations.",
