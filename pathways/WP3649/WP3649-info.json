    "description": "This pathway is modeled after figure 5 from Kweon et al. The WNT signaling pathway activates Beta-catenin which inhibits serine and cysteine proteases. This inhibition  of these proteins increases MeCP2 stability and induces epigenetic repression of Ppar-y leading to hepatic stellate cell myofibroblastic activation causing liver fibrosis which can lead to liver cirrhosis.",
