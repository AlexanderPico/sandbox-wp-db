description: Osteoblasts are specialized, terminally differentiated cell of mesenchymal origin. They create dense, crosslinked collagen and also specialized proteins, including osteocalcin and osteopontin. This pathway illustrates various signaling pathways in osteoblasts relevant to collagen and protein production.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP322 CPTAC Assay Portal]
