    "description": "This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species.<p>The inference is based on Ensembl Compara orthology projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to the other species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.<p>Details of projection methods and parameters may be found <a href=\"/projection.html\">here.<\/a><p>  Source:[http://plantreactome.gramene.org/ Plant Reactome].",
