description: Cells and Molecules involved in local acute inflammatory response. Pathway based on Biocarta pathway (M3952) https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_LairPathway  Tissue damage induces the release of inflammatory signaling molecules. Additionally, bacterial infection stimulates an immune response. Bacterial infection can activate macrophages and induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-1. Both tissue damage and bacterial infection can induce complement activation, either via the alternative or classical pathway. Leukocytes can be attracted via pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by mast cells and activated macrophages. Leukocytes can also induce complement activation.  The combined response can result in a more permeable endothelium of blood vessels, induce swelling and activate immune cells.
