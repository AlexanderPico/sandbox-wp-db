    "description": "An important cofactor for carboxylation reaction is the vitamin Biotin. Four carboxylase groups (ACC, MCC, PCC and PC) are activated by binding to biotin and forming holocarboxylases, which in turn are responsible for several metabolic conversion in the Fatty Acid Synthesis, Leucine catabolism, propanoate metabolism and gluconeogenesis. Except for the ACC conversion from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA starting the fatty acid synthesis, all other three interactions are connected to disorders. Furthermore, one can distinguish two \"multiple carboxylase defects\" (MCDs), which are connected to the conversion of biocytin into biotin (BTD), or unbound biotin to one of the apocarboxylases (HCSD).   This pathway was inspired by Chapter 14 (edition 4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).",
