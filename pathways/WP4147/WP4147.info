description: By summarizing published data together with our own results, this pathway shows a complicated relationships between transcriptional factors, miRNAs and some functional genes which are correlated together to generate a whole sight in early mouse development centered around Ptf1a, although there are some hypothetical relationships and the distinct development of dorsal and ventral pancreas in very early stage is neglected.
