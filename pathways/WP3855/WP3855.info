description: This pathway is modeled after figure 4b from kwon et al. Expression of specific miRNA in Cmah-null mice (mice that develop fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and characteristics of type 2 diabetes after being fed a high fat diet) are disregulated, leading to the development of complications. The disregulated miRNA influence the expression of their target genes through interaction with the Insulin signaling and the PI3K/AKT signalling pathways.
