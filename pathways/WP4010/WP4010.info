description: This liver steatosis AOP starts from the top with different molecular initiating events going down towards liver steatosis. The black nodes are Key Events and green nodes are molecular pathways.   Adverse outcome pathway liver steatosis; the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes, caused either by over-nutrition, visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome, or environmental toxins. Liver steatosis can be divided into three main categories: alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD), and toxicant-associated liver disease (TAFLD).[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28210688/ Review on liver steatosis]
