description: Interleukin-1 Induced activation of NF-kB through the phosphorylated TRAF6/Ajuba/PKCz/SQST1 complex. The pathway is defined by multiple binding steps to the TRAF6/Ajuba/PKCz/SQST1 complex. The small arrows constitute a earlier binding. After binding occurs the complex is phosphorylated and activates NF-kB. This pathway is based on figure 6 from Li et al.
