    "description": "In biochemistry, eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by oxidation of twenty-carbon essential fatty acids, (EFAs). They exert complex control over many bodily systems, mainly in inflammation or immunity, and as messengers in the central nervous system. Source: [[wikipedia:Eicosanoid|Wikipedia]].  This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids pathway [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php]. For Homo sapiens, the information from this pathway has been integrated with the pre-existing pathway at [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP167|WikiPathways].",
