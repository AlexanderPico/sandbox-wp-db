    "description": "Simplified PDGFR-beta pathway, based on figure 7B from Zhang et al: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372738  Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family. PDGF subunits -A and -B are important factors regulating cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, cell growth, development and many diseases including cancer. There are two forms of the PDGFR, alpha and beta each encoded by a different gene. Depending on which growth factor is bound, PDGFR homo- or heterodimerizes.
