    "description": "Interleukin 17 is a family of cytokines that acts as potent mediators in delayed-type reactions by increasing chemokine production in various tissues to recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation, similar to Interferon gamma. IL-17 is produced by T-helper cells and is induced by IL-23 which results in destructive tissue damage in delayed-type reactions. Interleukin 17 as a family functions as proinflammatory cytokines that responds to the invasion of the immune system by extracellular pathogens. Interleukin 17 acts synergistically with tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1.",
