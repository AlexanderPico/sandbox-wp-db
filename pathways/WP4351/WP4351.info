description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Omega-9 and other fatty acids [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php]. Omega-9 FAs (Fatty acids) are fats which can be obtained from diet, but also produced endogenously. These lipids are monounsaturated (indicating one double bonds in the lipid tail).The position of the double bond is counted from the tail end of the lipid chain. This pathway also indicated saturated fats (without a double bond), such as stearic acid, arachidic acid etc.
