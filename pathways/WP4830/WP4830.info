description: GDNF-RET signalling is at the core of the signalling network in kidney development. These signalling interactions between the metanephric mesenchyme and the nephric duct are crucial to ensure the induction of the ureter from the nephric duct.  Pathway converted from original mouse pathway WP4820.
