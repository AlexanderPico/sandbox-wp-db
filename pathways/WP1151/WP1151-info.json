    "description": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is central to the control of blood pressure and the target of several types of anti-hypertensive drugs. This pathway depicts a simplified representation of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of RAAS-acting drugs including candidate genes for the pharmacogenomics (PGx) of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), renin inhibitor aliskiren and aldosterone receptor antagonists.
