    "description": "Folates play an essential role in one-carbon methyl transfer reactions, mediating several biological processes (e.g. DNA synthesis, epigentics by methylation, embryonic central nervous system development, cata-/anabolism of amino acids, and anabolism of thymidines, purines, and neurotransmitters. The biologically active folic acid derivative is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF). Dietary folate is absorbed in the intestine, and stored in the liver for few months. [rephrased from chapter 10 of Blau et al, ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)].   For more detail on MTHFR deficiency, please visit [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4288].",
