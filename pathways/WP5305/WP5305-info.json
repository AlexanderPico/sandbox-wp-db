Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final glycolipid) p Numbers are the sphingomap IDs, to be converted.  Metabolites with a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product as several different routes could occur.",
