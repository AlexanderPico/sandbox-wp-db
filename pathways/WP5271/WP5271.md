description: This pathway depicts the bacterial ceramide synthesis; bacteria are known
  to produces various groups of sphingolipids. This lipid class holds several physiological
  functions. In the human microbiome, commensal and pathogenic bacteria use sphingolipids
  to mimic the inflammatory system of the host.  Several key eukaryotic ceramide synthesis
  enzymes have no bacterial homologue, which creates a challenge in understanding
  their biosynthetic pathway(s).  Sphingolipids have only been measured in a few bacterial
  taxa (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris)[PMID:29863195] and with great
  variety of acyl chain length and hydroxylation, headgroups, and the saturation degree.
  All of these variables influence the role of a sphingolipid on the host system and
  are therefore important to study in different bacteria.  This pathway uses the example
  of C. Vibriodes (supported by BridgeDb and Ensembl); the publication describing
  this pathway was originally written for C. crescentus [PMID:34969973]; identifiers
  for data analysis might be found through the CauloBrowser tool [PMID:26476443].
