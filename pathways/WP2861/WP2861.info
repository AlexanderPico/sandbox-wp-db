description: This plant pathway represents the photosynthetic electron transport chain (chloroplast). Ligh is absorbed by photosystem II and electrons are released and transported through the chain and finally used by ferredoxin NADP+ reductase to reduce NADP+ into NADPH. The electron transport generates a proteom gradient that powers an ATPase to generate ATP. Both NADPH and ATP produced by this process are mostly used by the Calvin cycle (WP2860).
