description: The primary cilium is related Hedgehog signaling, embryonic and brain[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030052] development. When it is disregulated, it leads to ciliopathies[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21210154].  The genes in this pathway are related to several ciliary structures, which have been discovered with genome-wide CRISPR-mediated gene disruption.
