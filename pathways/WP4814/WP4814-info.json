    "description": "This pathway describes the sex determination in a fetus.  For the male development the SRY gene plays an important role, leading to the SOX9 expression which will then stimulate AMH expression and testis development. In adults DMRT1 and SOX9 inhibit the FOXL2 gene, maintaining the male sex determination.  For the female development the WNT4 and RSPO1 signaling pathways lead to beta-catenin accumulation which inhibits SOX9 and the development of ovaries. In adults, Foxl2 repress Sox9 expression to maintain ovarian identity.",
