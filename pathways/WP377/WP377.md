description: Meiotic double strand breaks are initiated by Spo11, a conserved topoisomerase-derived
  protein, together with its partner subunits. After the breaks are formed, Spo11
  remains covalently attached to the 5 prime strands at both ends of the DNA. It is
  released through an endonucleolytic cleavage reaction, which is facilitated by MRX
  (Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2) and Sae2. This reaction liberates Spo11, which is attached
  to a short oligonucleotide. The 5 prime strands are further processed by exonucleases,
  such as Exo1 in yeast, leading to the production of long single-stranded tails.
  These tails are coated with RPA, an ssDNA-binding protein, before being replaced
  by recombinases Rad51 and Dmc1. The recombinases form a nucleoprotein filament and
  search for sequence similarity, which is primarily located on the homologous chromosome.
  This process leads to the production of D-loop structures.
