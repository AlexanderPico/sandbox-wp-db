description: Biotransformation is the chemical modification (or modifications) made
  by an organism on a chemical compound. If this modification ends in mineral compounds
  like CO2, NH4+, or H2O, the biotransformation is called mineralisation.  Biotransformation
  means chemical alteration of chemicals such as nutrients, amino acids, toxins, and
  drugs in the body. It is also needed to render non-polar compounds polar so that
  they are not reabsorbed in renal tubules and are excreted. Biotransformation of
  xenobiotics can dominate toxicokinetics and the metabolites may reach higher concentrations
  in organisms than their parent compounds.
