    "description": "The peptidoglycan layers of many gram-positive bacteria (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are densely functionalized with anionic glycopolymers called wall teichoic acids (WTAs). These polymers play crucial roles in cell shape determination, regulation of cell division, and other fundamental aspects of gram-positive bacterial physiology. Additionally, WTAs are important in pathogenesis and play key roles in antibiotic resistance. Based on http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/biocyc/",
