description: The Hippo-Merlin(NF2) signaling pathway can become dysregulated at many points as observed in malignant mesothelioma cells. Extracellular signals via cadherin, CD44, integrin or RTKs, as well as various signaling pathway components, can affect NF2 tumor suppression. Direct alteration of merlin and LATS1/2 can also result in underphosphorylated (activated) YAP1(YY1AP1)/TAZ transcriptional coactivators, leading to the induction of pro-oncogene expression.
