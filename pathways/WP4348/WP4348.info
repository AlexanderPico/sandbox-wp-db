description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids Pathway expended pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php]. Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA), either via cyclooxygenases (COX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347], lipooxygenases(LOX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348], or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349]. This pathway visualises the second route, via LOX. Green and orange boxes represent receptors, where the orange colour depicts peroxisome-proliferator activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.
