description: The CFTR receptor (an ion channel, which transports CL- out of the cell) can form a complex with CFTR assiciated protein (CAL), followed by degradation. If NHERF1 is present it will form a complex with the CFTR receptor (by binding the PDZ1 region), inhibiting degradation. This complex will bind to other proteins / ion channels. One of these ion channels is the Slc26 family, which binds to the PDZ2 region of NHERF1. After forming this complex  Cl- and NaHCO3 secretion will be performed. The same thing happens with the ENaC (an ion channel, which transports Na+), which consists of 3 subunits (alfa, beta & gamma). This channels binds YES-accosiated protein (YAP), which in his turn binds the PDZ2 region of NHERF1. Also c-YES will bind to NHERF1, which inhibits the ENaC channel. By forming this complex Cl- secretion will be induced, while Na+ absorption will be reduced.
