description: 'The 2q21.1 copy number variation syndrome can result in the loss of
  up to 9 protein-coding genes. Deletions and duplications in 2q21.1 were reported
  to be connected to intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior
  (DOI: 10.1002/mgg3.1135,DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.36357). The clinical picture was explained
  by alterations in five genes important for neurological development, namely GPR148,
  FAM123C, ARHGEF4, FAM168B and PLEKHB2 (DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.36357,DOI: 10.1093/hmg/dds166).
  Analogically, changes in tubulin genes in 2q21.1 were linked to Motor Timing in
  ADHD (DOI: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.06.006).'
