    "description": "Pathogens are recognized by complement C1q or immunoglobulin (IgG) that bind to microglia complement receptors (e.g., ITGAM/ITGB2) or Fc-receptors (e.g., FCGR1) that signal via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecules TYROBP or FCER1G, respectively. Alternatively, pathogens are directly recognized by classical innate immune receptors (e.g., TREM2) that require the interaction with TYROBP for further signaling.  This pathway was converted from the original human pathway to mouse.",
