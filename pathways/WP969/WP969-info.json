    "description": "Muscle contraction is the process where muscle tissue is activated by a signal from the nervous system. In case of voluntary action the nervous signals are initiated from the brain by so called action potentials. With reflexes these potentials are coming directly from the spinal chord. Striated muscles are a group of muscles also called skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.",
