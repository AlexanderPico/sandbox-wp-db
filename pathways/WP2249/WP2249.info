description: Interaction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and abnormal methylation to control metastasis. Tumor growth and metastasis formation through down regulation of their oncogenic targets such as MYC, E2F3 and cyclin-dependent kinase(CDK6).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2249 CPTAC Assay Portal]
