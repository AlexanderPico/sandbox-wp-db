    "description": "GABP alpha/beta complex mediates the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through control of proteins necessary for epigenetic modification and transcription regulation. The activation of key transcription factors and proteins required for HSC survival, self renewal, quiescence, differentiation, and aging is controlled by the GABP alpha/beta complex. This complex also down-regulates GZMB, protein important for inhibiting HSC survival. This pathway is based on figure 7 from Yu et al.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3657 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
