description: 'This diagram shows which skeletal dysplasias are caused by abnormalities
  in in TGF-beta signalling. The diagram is based on pathway: [[Pathway:WP560|TGF-beta
  Receptor Signaling (Homo sapiens)]].  Dotted arrows indicates that a disease is
  caused by mutation in the respective gene.  The exact role of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2
  is currently unknown, they are known to interact with FBN1.  The Transforming growth
  factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway is involved in many cellular processes in both
  the adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation,
  apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide
  range of cellular processes that the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process
  is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which
  recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates
  receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD
  complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and
  participate in the regulation of target gene expression. (source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_signaling_pathway
