description: Despite being the first conjugation reaction demonstrated in humans,
  amino acid conjugation as a route of metabolism of xenobiotic carboxylic acids is
  not well characterised. This is principally due to the small number and limited
  structural diversity of xenobiotic substrates for amino acid conjugation. Unlike
  CYP and uridine 5′-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, which are localised in the
  endoplasmic reticulum, the enzymes of amino acid conjugation reside in mitochondria.
  Unique among drug metabolism pathways, amino acid conjugation involves initial formation
  of a xenobiotic acyl-CoA thioester that is then conjugated principally with glycine
  in humans. Exogenously administered benzoic acid is metabolised to hippuric acid
  with a conjugation reaction in humans (as discovered in the first metabolism study
  in humans).
