description: This pathway is based on figure 7 from Li et al. Formation of MyD88 dimer catalyzes formation of IRAK1/TRAF6 complex. UEV1A and Ubc13 ubiquinate TRAF6 which allow for the activation of NFKB and AP-1 through canonical IKK phosphorylation. This complex also induces the production of reactive oxygen species.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3877 CPTAC Assay Portal].
