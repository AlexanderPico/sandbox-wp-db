Model for supramolecular assembly of cartilage fibrils and filaments into fibrillar networks: Matrilin-3 and COMP act as adaptor molecules to interconnect D-periodically banded fibrils with each other and/or with collagen VI beaded filaments to generate a heterotypic fibrillar network. The interaction may be mediated either by matrilin-1 / -3 binding directly to collagen IX or via COMP, which associates with the NC domains of collagen IX.  Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.",
