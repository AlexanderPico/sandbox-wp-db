description: The vitamin D receptor (VDR, a.k.a. NR1I1) is a nuclear receptor that responds to binding of vitamin D and subsequently forms a dimer with RXR to induce transcription of its target genes. It mainly regulates genes cytochrome P450 genes involved in xenobiotic biotransformation.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2877 CPTAC Assay Portal].
